        <p>
            Won the most innovative undergrad project award in the final year of engineering 
            for designing a <em>Solar Power Electronic Integrator Switch</em> that allowed users 
            to exceed normal inverter capacity. This switch automatically and sequentially 
            transferred excess load to another power source, enabling dynamic backup power usage 
            instead of restricting users to only a small set of appliances.
